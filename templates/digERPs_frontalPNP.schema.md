This is a proof of concept aimed to digitalize papers in table 2 of the paper by Van Petten and Luka (2012) Int. Jou. of Psychophy. 83, 176â€“190. In this review a number of ERPs papers on sentence processing are considered by looking at contrasts between higher- and lower-cloze congruent sentence completions. Papers typically contain multiple experiments, please add an element array for each experiment, in this case the field expname becomes required.
